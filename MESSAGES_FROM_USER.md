inspect md document to see if any of the tips there can be used, and migrate code to using a glsl shader (if that speeds it up, especially for deep zooms)

can u add input field for iteration count and make it so any zoom immediately cancels the running task and doesn't run any more until zoom is done, zoom should just render scaled current render

point filter (not bilinear) fractal so more crisp (especially when zooming), add supersampling, optimize fractal gpu rendering around like 2^270, see eg http://100.68.218.82:8111/#re=-1.369078017863660784890619576747781310848768032841633323730495873496232879296538490243106365484246242476783355722&im=-0.071817675972918479944583194368632476442138106251769795140812120871593742404751576456750164324645880810732436640&r=5.99473960e-82&i=28500&p=ultra&cy=48&sh=0 u should have access to gpu now

add click-to-zoom in clicked location and optimize the deep zoom pertubation gpu shaders until it can run fast on swiftshader

## 2026-06-23T00:23:31Z

let's optimize the gpu deep zoom further

## 2026-06-23T02:03:52Z

let's let us zoom in past 2^218

## 2026-06-23T03:17:59Z

could you figure out why gpu not working (you have access to one) for the tests so you can profile the shaders
